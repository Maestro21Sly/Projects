Write method getLeaves that finds and removes the leaves in a binary tree, 
repeating this process in a sequence of rounds until the tree is empty. 
The method returns an array representing each round of leaf removal until the tree is empty.
Leaves should be visited using an in-order traversal (first left, then right). 
Each round of leaf-removal is represented by a string with each leaf value removed separated by a space. 
See the examples for details.

The returned array contains as many strings are there are rounds of leaf-removal before the tree is empty.

The TreeNode class will be accessible when your method is tested.
