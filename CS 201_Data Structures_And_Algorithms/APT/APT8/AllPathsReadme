Write method paths that returns an array of all the root-to-leaf paths in its tree parameter. 
Paths are represented as a string of parent-child node values with the string "->" between each. 
See the examples for details. The returned array should be sorted.
Leaves have no children.

In the tree diagrammed below, the call paths(t) should return:

{"5->2->6","5->3->4->1", "5->3->4->7","5->3->8"}

since there are three root-to-leaf paths. Note that the tree is not necessarily a search tree and the returned array is in sorted order.
