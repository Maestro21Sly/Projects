When text is encoded using Huffman codes, each symbol is replaced by a string of 0s and 1s called a bit string representation. 
The replacement is done in such a way that the bit string representation of a symbol is 
never the prefix of the bit string representation of any other symbol. This property allows us to unambiguously decode the encoded text.
You will be given a String archive and a String[] dictionary. 
The i-th element of dictionary will be the bit string representation of the i-th uppercase letter. 
Decode archive using dictionary and return the result as a single String.
