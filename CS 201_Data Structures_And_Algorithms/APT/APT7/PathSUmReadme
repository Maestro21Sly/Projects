Write a method that returns 1 if there is a root-to-leaf path whose node values sum to target and 
returns 0 if there is no such root-to-leaf path.
For example, in the tree below there are exactly four root-to-leaf paths. 
The sums on these paths are 27, 22, 26, 18, so hasPathSum(22,tree) will 
return 1 for the tree shown and hasPathSum(32,tree) will return 0 for the tree shown.
