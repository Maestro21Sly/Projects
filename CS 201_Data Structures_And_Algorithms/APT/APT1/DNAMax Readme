Write code to find which of the strands representing DNA in an array String[] strand 
representing strands of DNA has the most occurrences of the nucleotide represented by parameter nuc.
If more than one strand has the same maximal number of the specified nucleotide 
you should return the longest strand with the maximal number. 
All DNA strands have different lengths in this problem so the maximal strand will be unique when length is accounted for. 
Return this uniquely maximal strand.

Each String representing a DNA strand will contain only cytosine, guanine, thymine, and adenine, 
represented by the characters 'c', 'g', 't', and 'a', respectively. 
If no strand in the array contains the specified nucleotide return the empty string "".
