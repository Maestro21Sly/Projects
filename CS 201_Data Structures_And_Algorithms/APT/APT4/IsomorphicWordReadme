Two words are called isomorphic if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word. 
Remapping a letter means replacing all occurrences of it with another letter. 
The ordering of the letters remains unchanged. No two letters may map to the same letter, but a letter may map to itself.
For example, the words "abca" and "zbxz" are isomorphic because we can map 'a' to 'z', 'b' to 'b' and 'c' to 'x'.

Given a String[] words, return how many (unordered) pairs of words are isomorphic.
