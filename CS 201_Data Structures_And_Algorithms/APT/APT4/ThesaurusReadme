An entry in a Thesaurus is a list of words that are all synonyms. 
Each entry contains no duplicates within it. It is possible that two entries might have some common words, 
but the editors (who are somewhat cheap) have decided that if any two entries have 2 or more words in common 
then they should be combined into a single entry.
This editing process may produce new entries which can be combined. 
The final Thesaurus must contain no pair of entries that have 2 or more words in common. 
Of course, each entry must contain no duplicates.

Create a class Thesaurus that contains a method edit that is given a String[] entry, the entries in the original Thesaurus. 
The method returns the edited Thesaurus as a String[]. 
Each element of entry has no leading or trailing spaces and has its words separated by a single space. 
Each element of the return should also have no leading or trailing spaces and have its words separated by a single space. 
In addition, the words within each element of the return must be in alphabetical order, 
and the elements in the return must appear in alphabetical order.
