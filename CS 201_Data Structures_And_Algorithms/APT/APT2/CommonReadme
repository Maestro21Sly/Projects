Two strings have a letter in common if it appears in both strings. 
The position of letter is not important for it to be counted as common. 
Once a particular letter is counted as in common, it cannot be counted again. 
For example, an o appearing twice in one word but only once in the other counts only as one letter in common. 
However, an o appearing twice both words counts as two letters in common.
Write a function that takes two strings and returns the number of letters they have in common.

Hint: you will need some way to avoid counting a letter more than once if it is in common to both words. 
Recall that strings are immutable.
