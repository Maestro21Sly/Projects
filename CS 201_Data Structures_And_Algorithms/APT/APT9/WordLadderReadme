A word ladder is a sequence of words in which each word can be transformed into the next word by changing one letter. 
For example, the word ladder below changes 'lot' to 'log'.
   lot dot dog log
This is not the shortest word-ladder between 'lot' and 'log' since the former 
can be immediately changed to the latter yielding a word ladder of length two:
  lot log
The first and last words in a word ladder are the anchor rungs of the ladder. 
Any other words are interior rungs. For example, there are three interior rungs in the ladder below between 'smile' and 'evote'.
   smile smite smote emote evote
In this problem you'll write a method that has parameters representing potential interior rungs: 
an array of strings (these may be nonsense or English words), and the anchor rungs --- two strings. 
Your code must determine whether there exists a minimal-length ladder between the exterior rungs that uses at least one interior rung. 
If there is any such ladder the method returns "ladder", otherwise it should return "none".
