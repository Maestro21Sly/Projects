To solve the original graph problem you must find the size of all connected components in an undirected graph. 
Given a list of connections, return an int[] with the same number of entries as there are connected components in the graph. 
The returned array should be sorted.
Vertices are labeled conceptually as integer values from 0 to N-1 where N is the number of strings in parameter data --- 
which is a list of strings in which the kth is a space-delimited sequence of those vertices connected to vertex k.

The graph below has two connected componenets and the String[] data for this graph is 
["1 2","0 2","1 3","2 4","3 5","4 6","5 4","8 9","7 9","7 8"] showing, for example, 
that vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 2 and that vertex 7 is connected to vertices 8 and 9. 
The return value for this input is [3,7] since the compenent with vertices 7,8,9 is size 3 and the other connected component has size 7.
