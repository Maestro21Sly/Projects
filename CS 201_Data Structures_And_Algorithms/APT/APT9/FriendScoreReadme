You want to determine the most popular person in a social network. 
To do this, you will count the number of "2-friends" that each person has. 
Person A is called a 2-friend of another person B if they are friends with each other or 
if there exists some person C who is a friend of both A and B. 
The most popular person is the person with the highest number of 2-friends. 
(There might be more than one if multiple people all have the maximal number of 2-friends.)
You are given a String[] friends, where the j-th character of the i-th element is 'Y' if person i and person j are friends, 
and 'N' otherwise. Return the number of 2-friends of the most popular person in this social network.
