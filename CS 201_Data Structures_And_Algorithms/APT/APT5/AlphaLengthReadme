Write a method create that creates a linked-list of nodes 
whose values are the lengths of the unique strings in words when considered in alphabetical order.
For example, if words = ["dog", "cat", "yak", "cow", "cat", "dog"] 
the return list would represent the word-lengths of ["cat", "cow", "dog", "yak"] 
and the method you write would return a linked-list represented by [3,3,3,3]. 
The ListNode class will be accessible when your method is tested.


public class ListNode {
    int info;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x){
        info = x;
    }
    ListNode(int x, ListNode node){
        info = x;
	next = node;
    }
}
