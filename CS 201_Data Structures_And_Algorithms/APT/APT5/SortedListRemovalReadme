Write method uniqify to remove all duplicate values from a sorted linked list of integer values, 
leaving the unique values occurring once and in order. 
For example, the list represented by [1,1,2,3,3,3,4] would be changed to [1,2,3,4]. 
You should remove nodes and relink nodes rather than creating a new list.
The ListNode class will be accessible when your method is tested
