Given a linked list of single-digit numbers, return a long value whose digits are in the same order as the digits in the linked list.
You may find the expressions in the jshell session below useful.

jshell> int x = 31
x ==> 31

jshell> int y = x*10 + 2
y ==> 312

jshell> int z = y*10 + 5
z ==> 312

For example, for the list 1->3->0->5 the value 1305 should be returned.
The ListNode class will be accessible when your method is tested.
