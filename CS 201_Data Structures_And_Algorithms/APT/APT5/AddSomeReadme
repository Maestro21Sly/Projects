Problem Statement

Complete method splice that creates a copy of the first size nodes of a linked list and 
splices them into the list after the first size nodes so that the total number of nodes in the list increases by size.
For example, the list [1,2,3,4,5] will change to the list [1,2,3,1,2,3,4,5] when size == 3, to the list [1,1,2,3,4,5] 
when size == 1 and to [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5] when size == 5.

Return a pointer to the first node of the changed list.

The ListNode class will be accessible when your method is tested.


public class ListNode {
    int info;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x){
        info = x;
    }
    ListNode(int x, ListNode node){
        info = x;
	next = node;
    }
}
