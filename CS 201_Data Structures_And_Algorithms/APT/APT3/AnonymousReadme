If you want to write a message anonymously, 
one way to do it is to cut out letters from headlines in a newspaper and paste them onto a blank piece of paper 
to form the message you want to write. 
Given several headlines that you have cut out, 
determine how many messages from a list you can write using the letters from the headlines. 
You should only consider each message by itself and not in conjunction with the others, see example 2.
Write the method howMany which takes as parameters a String[] headlines 
containing the headlines which you have cut out as well as a String[] messages with the messages you may want to write, 
and returns an int which is the total number of messages you can write.
