A prefix code is a set of words in which no word is a prefix of another word in the set. 
A word v is said to be a prefix of a word w if w starts with v.
An important property of prefix codes is that they are uniquely decodable. 
Prefix codes are commonly used - telephone numbers are an everyday example 
(as you probably don't want a stranger to pick up the phone call you make just because his number is a prefix of the number you intend to dial). 
Prefix codes are also very popular in computer science, the Huffman code used for data compression being a famous example.

Given a String[] words, return the String "Yes" if that set of words is a prefix code or 
return the String "No, i" if it is not, 
where i is replaced by the lowest 0-based index of a String in words that is a prefix of another String in words. 
(That index should have no extra leading zeros.)
