This Shows all the projects I had to complete for a Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering Class. 
Students learn core ECE concepts, providing a foundation on which subsequent courses build. 
These concepts include techniques for analyzing linear circuits, semiconductor and photonic devices, frequency representation, filtering, and combinational and sequential logic. 
Central to the course is an extensive design challenge that requires students to integrate knowledge across topics while honing practical design and project management skills. 
The course culminates in an exciting competition in which teams of robots race to overcome challenging obstacles using sensor data acquisition and processing.
